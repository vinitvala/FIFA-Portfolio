# FIFA-Styled Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my FIFA-inspired portfolio - where professional experience meets gaming aesthetics! This unique portfolio website reimagines the iconic FIFA menu interface to showcase my professional journey, skills, and achievements.

## 🎮 The Inspiration

Inspired by FIFA's legendary user interface design, this portfolio transforms the familiar gaming menu system into a professional showcase. Just as FIFA presents player stats, team formations, and career modes, this portfolio displays:

- **PLayer Career**: Professional experience presented like a player's career journey
- **Skills**: Skills and competencies displayed as player attributes
- **Team Lineup**: Projects arranged in a portfolio formation
- **Projects**: Educational background shown as seasonal achievements
- **Captains**: Leadership experience and achievements
